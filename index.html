                    The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) raises concerns about privacy as advanced algorithms often require extensive personal data. The collection and analysis of such information may lead to breaches, putting individuals' sensitive details at risk. Striking a balance between innovation and safeguarding privacy remains a crucial challenge in the development and deployment of AI technologies.

                    Additionally, the automation facilitated by AI has sparked fears of job displacement. As machines take on routine tasks, certain job categories face obsolescence, impacting employment rates and economic stability. The need for upskilling and retraining programs becomes imperative to mitigate the potential negative effects on the workforce.
